HOW DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS JOB? Newspaper Ad Websites (Which one?) Clallam County Website / Craigslist / Other ______________________________ Informed by Clallam County Employee Job Board inside the Courthouse AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN CLALLAM COUNTY INFORMATION FOR THE APPLICANT  The following is a brief explanation of the Clallam County Affirmative Action Policy. It describes-in a very condensed form-the reasons we request the affirmative action information and how that information is used by Clallam County. Most importantly, this supplement describes the safeguards Clallam County uses to protect the information received from the people who will make the hiring decisions.  WHY CLALLAM COUNTY HAS AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY . . .  The affirmative action policy exists to provide equal opportunity and treatment to women, minority groups, and all other persons who are employed by or are applying for employment with Clallam County. The information is used to correct the under-utilization of women and members of minorities at all levels of the County’s work force. The policy also provides that the County enter into contracts only with equal opportunity employers.  WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU GIVE US . . .  The information we request of you (sex, age, disability, race, etc.) is used to assist us in determining whether women and minorities are being under- utilized or barred from employment. “Under-utilization” is defined here as having fewer minorities or women working in a particular job classification than one would expect by the number of women and minorities present in our area. We also use the information to comply with any federal and state reporting requirements that inform the government how well we are doing in the recruitment and hiring of women and minorities.   HOW WE KEEP YOUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL . . .  The data you give us on the “Affirmative Action Information Sheet” is not recorded on any paper which is kept in a personnel file. In addition, it is not made available to anyone who determines your job qualifications. That would be considered an unfair employment practice on the part of the Clallam County. We have developed these procedures to guarantee that these safeguards are in place and are actually implemented  1. The “Affirmative Action Information Sheet” will be separated from the job application when it is received by an employee designated in the Human Resources Department to receive Clallam County job applications. It will be placed in a separate, confidential file before applications are processed and distributed to the department with the open position.  2. The information is kept in the confidential file until it is needed to implement a corrective employment program, or to consider or accommodate a disability as authorized by federal or state law or regulations. It is also used for statistical information, or to verify the statistics by the County or by the Washington State Human Rights Commission or other concerned governmental agencies. It is not subject to the inquiries or the viewing by any third party, except those administrative federal and state agencies who make a bona fide exception.  3. The data never becomes part of an employee’s personnel file.   Clallam County considers any breach or violation of these rules to be sufficient cause for discipline.   If you would like a copy of the complete Clallam County Affirmative Action Policy (Chapter 12 of the Clallam County Uniform Personnel Policies and Procedures) please contact the Clallam County Human Resources Department in person or by mail at the following address Clallam County Courthouse, 223 E. 4th St., Suite 16, Port Angeles, WA 98362, or call (360) 417-2241.  Clallam County is an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer.
